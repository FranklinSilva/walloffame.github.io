JBI is an international community of friends committed to education, language learning, and youth empowermentâ€”in a culture freed of caste prejudice and discrimination.

This project was ment to highlight the donators in the indiegogo campaign made to build the Lokuttara Leadership Academy in 2014. We achieved an amount of $10.000 on donations

This project is not about displaying my skills as software engineer, but instead, highlights an example of how my work can impact hundreds of lives.
